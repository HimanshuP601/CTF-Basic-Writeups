# 🔤 XORing ASCII — XORing Characters Byte by Byte

**Challenge Title:** XORing ASCII  
**Platform:** pwn.college  
**Category:** Cryptography  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Tags:** `ascii`, `bitwise`, `XOR`, `character encoding`, `python`

## 📝 Description

Much of cryptography involves **text encryption**. Text in computers is represented as **bytes**, using encoding standards like **ASCII** or **UTF-8**.

> In this challenge, we stick to **ASCII**, where each character has a fixed byte value (0–127).

Using XOR on characters becomes easy:
- Convert the character to its **ASCII code** (via `ord()` in Python).
- XOR it with a given key.
- Convert the result **back to a character** (via `chr()`).

You will be given an **encrypted character** and an **XOR key**. Your task is to decrypt it — that is, find the original character before encryption.

## 💡 ASCII Recap

Here’s how to view ASCII codes:

```bash
man ascii
```
Or use Python interactively:
```python
>>> ord('A')      # Get ASCII code
65
>>> chr(0x40)     # Get character from ASCII code
'@'
```
Example:
```
Encrypted Character: A
XOR Key: 0x01

ord('A') = 0x41  
0x41 ^ 0x01 = 0x40 → chr(0x40) = '@'
```
Answer: @
