# üîä Challenge: Listen

**Task:**  
From your host at `10.0.0.1`, listen on **port `31337`** for a connection from the remote host at `10.0.0.2`.

---

## üß† Understanding the Challenge

In networking, one host **listens** on a port, and the other **connects** to it. This challenge tests your ability to set up a listener using `netcat`, allowing a remote host to connect to you.

- This is the reverse of the usual connection setup.
- Once the connection is established, it becomes **bidirectional** (both sides can send/receive data).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution with Netcat

We use the `-l` option to make `nc` **listen** on the given port.

### ‚úÖ Command:

```bash
nc -l 31337
```
This command makes your system listen for incoming TCP connections on port 31337.

### Example Output
```
root@ip-10-0-0-1:~# nc -l 31337
