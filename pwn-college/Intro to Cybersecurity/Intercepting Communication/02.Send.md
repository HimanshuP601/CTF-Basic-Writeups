# üåê Connect ‚Äì Message Sending (pwn.college)

## üìå Task

From your host at `10.0.0.1`, connect to the remote host at `10.0.0.2` on port `31337`, and **send the message**: Hello, World!


You're instructed to use **netcat (nc)**. Unlike before, this time you **must send a message** to receive the flag.

---

## üß† Understanding the Setup

- You're communicating with a TCP server that expects **input** from the client.
- Netcat allows you to send input directly via typing or piping.
- Once the message is sent (by pressing Enter), the server will respond with a flag.

> üí° Netcat will appear to hang after sending; press `Ctrl-C` to quit once the flag is received.

## üîç How We Interact

Steps:
1. Use `nc 10.0.0.2 31337` to connect.
2. Type `Hello, World!` and press **Enter** to send.
3. The server replies with the flag.
4. Press `Ctrl-C` to exit the session.
