# Firewall2 üî•üß±üéØ

## üß† Task Description

**Challenge Name:** Firewall2  
**Platform:** pwn.college  
**Goal:** Your host at `10.0.0.1` is receiving traffic on port `31337`.  
Block **only** the traffic from `10.0.0.3`, while continuing to allow traffic from `10.0.0.2`.

---

## üîç Reconnaissance

Inspecting the challenge logic from `/challenge/run`:

```bash
root@ip-10-0-0-1:~# cat /challenge/run
```
### Key Logic:
- Two client hosts:
    - 10.0.0.2 - should remain allowed
    - 10.0.0.3 - must be blocked
- The server:
    - Tracks the last connection time from both IPs.
    - If 10.0.0.2 is active (connected within 2 seconds) and
10.0.0.3 is silent (no connection in 2 seconds), it reveals the flag.

So the goal is to block 10.0.0.3, while allowing 10.0.0.2.

### Exploitation: Selective Traffic Filtering with iptables
To block only 10.0.0.3 on port 31337, use:
```bash
iptables -A INPUT -s 10.0.0.3 -p tcp --dport 31337 -j DROP
```
```
pwn.college{c8j4FuuJ_RjQCrfC3hmDM6NtfeZ.0VO0AjNxwSM0IzMyEzW}
```

## Flag
```
pwn.college{c8j4FuuJ_RjQCrfC3hmDM6NtfeZ.0VO0AjNxwSM0IzMyEzW}
```
