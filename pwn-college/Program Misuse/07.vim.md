# Challenge Name: vim

**Platform**: pwn.college

## üß† Summary:
The challenge abuses a SUID bit set on `/usr/bin/vim`, allowing an unprivileged user to read the root-owned flag file at `/flag`.

---

## üîç Enumeration

```bash
ls -l /usr/bin/vim
```

output:
```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 47480 Sep  5  2019 /usr/bin/vim
```

-The `s` in `-rws` indicates it's a SUID binary.
-`vim` runs with **root privileges**.

## üöÄ Exploitation

The `sort` (Vi IMproved) is a highly configurable text editor for efficiently creating and changing any kind of text, so we can just use `vim` to read the flag.

```bash
vim /flag
```

Output:
```

"/flag" [readonly] 1L, 58C     
```
