# Challenge Name: emacs

**Platform**: pwn.college

## üß† Summary:
The challenge abuses a SUID bit set on `/usr/bin/emacs`, allowing an unprivileged user to read the root-owned flag file at `/flag`.

---

## üîç Enumeration

```bash
ls -l /usr/bin/emacs
```

output:
```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 47480 Sep  5  2019 /usr/bin/emacs
```

-The `s` in `-rws` indicates it's a SUID binary.
-`emacs` runs with **root privileges**.

## üöÄ Exploitation

The `emacs` is a powerful, fully-featured text editor (and programming environment) in Linux/Unix systems. It's like Vim‚Äôs geeky, customizable cousin ‚Äî often described as an operating system disguised as a text editor, so we can just use `emacs` to read the flag.

```bash
emacs /flag
```

Output:
