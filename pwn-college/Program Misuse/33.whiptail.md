## üß† Summary:
The challenge abuses a SUID bit set on `/usr/bin/whiptail`, allowing an unprivileged user to read the root-owned flag file at `/flag`.

---

## üîç Enumeration

```bash
ls -l /usr/bin/whiptail
```

Output:
```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 47480 Sep  5  2019 /usr/bin/whiptail
```

- The `s` in `-rws` indicates it's a SUID binary.
- `whiptail` runs with **root privileges**.

## üöÄ Exploitation

command in Linux is used to create simple text-based user interfaces (TUIs) in a terminal ‚Äî like dialog boxes, menus, input prompts, etc. It's great for shell scripts that need a bit of interactivity without a GUI.

`whiptail` is similar to dialog, but lighter and more widely available by default (especially on minimal systems like Alpine or Debian installs).

The whiptail --textbox option is used to display the contents of a file (like logs, help text, or flag output) in a scrollable box inside the terminal.


```bash
whiptail --textbox /flag 20 70
```

Output:
```
