# 🛡️ CTF Writeups – By Himanshu Parate

This repository contains my personal writeups from Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges.

Currently focused on:
- 🎯 [Pwn College](https://pwn.college): An exploitation-based platform created by Arizona State University.

Writeups are short, structured, and focused on red team learning, not walkthrough-style blogs.
